abstract: |
  We investigate the utility of Large Language
  Models for automated taxonomy generation
  and completion specifically applied to tax-
  onomies from the food technology industry. We
  explore the extent to which taxonomies can be
  completed from a seed taxonomy or generated
  without a seed from a set of known concepts,
  in an iterative fashion using recent prompting
  techniques. Experiments on five taxonomies
  using an open-source LLM (Llama-3), while
  promising, point to the difficulty of correctly
  placing inner nodes.
